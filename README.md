      "description": "I built a streamlined registration system for students at Yeshiva University. Registration time at YU is always highly stressful for students, so I created a solution that makes the process much less stressful. Students were able to enter all their registration information months in advance of registration. As soon as the student's registration slot opened, my solution would register them for their desired classes in around eight milliseconds. Approximately half the student body visited my app within a month of launch. This experience taught me how to design, build, and debug a distributed system and AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, Dynamo, and S3.   "
